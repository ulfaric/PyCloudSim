The class "vNIC" serves as the implementation of the network interface card in the simulation. It includes a queue specifically designed to store "vPacket" objects and has the capability to establish connections with other "vNIC" instances. The "vNIC" class is equipped with two resources: uplink bandwidth and downlink bandwidth. These resources are allocated to the transmission and reception of "vPacket" objects respectively. The transmission and reception functionalities of "vPacket" are implemented as member functions within the class. Upon receiving a "vPacket", a specialized "vProcess" called PacketHandler is created to simulate the decoding process and the associated processing delay. If there is insufficient uplink or downlink bandwidth available, the "vPacket" will be kept in the queue until the necessary resources become available.
