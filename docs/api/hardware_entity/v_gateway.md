The class "vGateway" is a unique implementation of the "PhysicalEntity" class. Unlike other entities, the "vGateway" does not possess a "vCPU", RAM, or ROM. Its primary role is to function as the entry point for the cloud environment, serving as the central hub for incoming and outgoing user traffic.

The "vGateway" inherits all the member functions implemented for the "vSwitch" class, allowing it to perform routing and switching operations. However, unlike other entities, the "vGateway" does not create a simulated process for packet decoding upon receiving simulated packets.

Additionally, the "vGateway" is designed to be linked exclusively with "vRouter" instances, facilitating seamless connectivity and routing between the gateway and the routers within the simulated network topology.
