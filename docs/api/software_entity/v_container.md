The class "vContainer" serves as an implementation of the abstract class "VirtualEntity" and emulates containers in Docker or Pods in Kubernetes. It encompasses the following essential attributes and member functions:

1. CPU: Represents the CPU time limit allocated to the "vContainer".
2. RAM: Denotes the maximum amount of RAM that the "vContainer" can utilize.
3. Simulated API Call Queue: Stores the simulated API calls associated with the "vContainer".
4. Simulated Process Queue: Holds the simulated processes assigned to the "vContainer".
5. Crash Handling: If the RAM consumed by all the simulated processes in the queue surpasses the container's RAM capacity, the "vContainer" will crash. Consequently, all processes in the queue will be terminated and marked as failed.
6. Simulated Daemon Process: The "vContainer" may include a simulated daemon process that mimics resource usage when the container is idle. This daemon process operates continuously until the "vContainer" is terminated.

Overall, the "vContainer" encapsulates the behavior and characteristics of containerized environments, providing capabilities for resource allocation, process management, and crash handling within the simulated cloud environment.
